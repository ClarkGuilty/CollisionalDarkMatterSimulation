The search for dark matter is a joint quest between particle physics and astrophysics. From astronomical observations and cosmological simulations we know that the dark matter particle is not in the standard model. Therefore,  it is essential to obtain bounds on its properties. One way to do so are dark matter simulations. Traditionally, dark matter has been simulated as a collisionless fluid, this approximation has been successful at explaining the universe on a large scale. However, when it comes to smaller scales some inconsistencies are observed, also, a collisionless approach implies a null scattering cross section.

Using a integer lattice method to solve the Boltzmann equation, we can simulate the phase space of a collisional dark matter fluid. To model the collisional term we use the thermally averaged scattering cross section and an equilibrium distribution. In this work we did a 1D numerical simulation of the phase space of a colisional dark matter fluid. We also simulated a simplified version of (systems of interest like) the Bullet Cluster, and obtained the explicit time evolution of the phase space distribution. Thus, obtaining information about the velocity distribution, which is essential in order to make a direct detection of a dark matter particle.

After this proof of concept, the next step is to develop an integer lattice 3D simulation and recreate more accurate initial conditions.
