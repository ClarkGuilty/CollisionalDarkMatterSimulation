[Empezar con una motivacion de fisica de particulas] Traditionally, dark matter has been simulated as a collisionless fluid, this approximation has been successful at explaining the universe on a large scale, however, when it comes to smaller scales some inconsistencies are observed, thus motivating a collisional approach. 

[Pero yo tengo un codigo que permite simular el fluido colisional]
The collisional term is modelled using the thermally averaged scattering cross section and an equilibrium distribution. 

In this work we did a 1D numerical simulation of the phase space of a colisional dark matter fluid. 

//We solve the Boltzmann equation in a integer lattice phase space. 

//The use of an integer lattice allows for a conservative, Lagrangian and time-reversable algorithm, also reducing the phase space to an //integer lattice simplifies the computational complexity of the simulation. 

//In the limit of high resolution, the lattice converges to the real and continuous phase space. 

[Y ademas simulamos la version simplificada de un sistema astrofisico de interes: el bullet cluster] Here, we simulate the phase space of large scale structures like the Coma Cluster, and the Bullet Cluster. 

// The system to simulate is defined by the initial conditions, a single galaxy cluster has a gaussian distribution as initial conditions. 

// A system of two colliding clusters (such as the Bullet Cluster) has two gaussian distributions with their means separeted a given distance as initial conditions. 

[Y se puede obtener la evolucion explicita de la distribucion en el espacio de fase, y esto de informacion sobre la distribucion de velocidades, algo relevante para estudios de detecion directa de materia oscura.]

//Given the unknown nature of the dark matter particle, we make use of the Fermi-Dirac distribution or the Bose-Einstein distribution as an equilibrium distribution. 

[Que viene en el futuro? 3D y condiciones iniciales mas realistas.]
